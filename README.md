### Hi there üëã and welcome to my profile (Updated August 2025)

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Who am I? ‚ÅâÔ∏è
My name is Jason and I've been a web developer for around 20 years (if we include my college and university studies).

One of my absolute passions in life is learning and as such I've worked with a tonne of different technologies in the past and continue to spend atleast 1-2 hours expanding my web development knowledge everyday.

**My current areas of focus for my mini projects:** (these will change as time goes on)
* Working with AI Apis, ChatGPT / Langchain etc... 
* Next.js
* .Net Core C# E-commerce 

**Books / Articles I'm enjoying**
* Engineer's Survival Guide - [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Engineers-Survival-Guide-Facebook-Microsoft/dp/B09MBZBGFK)
* Pragmatic Programmer - [book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B07VRS84D1/)
* Reflections on 10,000 hours of programming - [article](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/)
