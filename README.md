### Hi there üëã and welcome to my profile

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Who am I? ‚ÅâÔ∏è
My name is Jason and I've been a web developer for around 15+ years (if we include my college and university studies).

One of my absolute passions in life is learning and as such I've worked with a tonne of different technologies in the past and continue to spend atleast 1-2 hours expanding my web development knowledge everyday.

The areas of real focus as of November 2020 for myself are: (these will change as time goes on)
* Javascript frameworks - Angular and React
* NestJs 
* Node
* Unit testing
* Progressive web apps

## ‚úîÔ∏è Development Experience ‚úîÔ∏è
